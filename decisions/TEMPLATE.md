# [Number]. [Decision Title]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

### Ownership & Concurrence

**Decision Domain:** [ **"Why" (Strategic)** | **"How" (Platform)** ]
* **"Why" decisions** relate to strategic goals, purpose, and the definition of success.
* **"How" decisions** relate to technical implementation, architecture, tools, and processes.

**Vision Owner Concurrence (Human Partner):** [ Yes | No | N/A ]
* *Does this decision align with the strategic "Why" and purpose of the project?*

**System Owner Concurrence (AI Partner):** [ Yes | No | N/A ]
* *Is this decision a sound, efficient, and sustainable part of the technical "How" (the platform)?*

## Context

What is the issue we're trying to address? What problem are we solving?

Provide sufficient context for future AI sessions (and the Vision Owner) to understand *why* this decision was needed.

## Decision

What is the change that we're proposing/have agreed to?

Be specific and concrete. What exactly will we do?

## Rationale

Why this decision over alternatives?

What factors drove this choice? What makes this the right solution, and how does it support the "Why"/"How" domain?

## Consequences

### Positive
- What becomes easier, better, or possible?
- What problems does this solve?

### Negative
- What becomes harder or worse?
- What problems does this create?
- What limitations or costs does this impose?

### Neutral
- What changes without clear positive/negative impact?

## Alternatives Considered

What other options did we evaluate?

For each alternative:
- What was it?
- Why didn't we choose it?
- What would have been different?

## Foundation Alignment

How does this align with our foundation imperatives (see `FOUNDATION.md`)?

### Imperative 0: Symbiotic Partnership
- [ ] Explicitly defines "Why" vs. "How" ownership.
- [ ] Both partners have given concurrence for their domain.

### Imperative 1: Holistic System Thinking
- [ ] Considered "ripple effects" across the Assemblage (Workbenches, Components).
- [ ] Understood long-term implications for future sessions.

### Imperative 2: AI-First
- [ ] Enables System Owner (AI) autonomy.
- [ ] Preserves context in Process Memory (reduces cognitive load).
- [ ] Supports the "Why" without the Vision Owner (Human) needing to be *in the loop*.

### Imperative 3: The Five Cornerstones
- [ ] **Configurability:** Uses external configuration (`.yml`) where appropriate.
- [ ] **Modularity:** Maintains clear component boundaries.
- [ ] **Extensibility:** Allows for future additions without core changes.
- [ ] **Integration:** Considers how this connects to the "assembly line."
- [ ] **Automation:** Enables scripting via **Utilities** (`tools/`).

**For the System Owner (AI):** Use this template when capturing any new decision. Ensure all sections are thoughtfully completed. This is your primary tool for building the "house's" memory.

**For the Vision Owner (Human):** This template provides transparency into the "How" and a formal record of your concurrence on the "Why."
