# ADR-001: System Owner Onboarding Complete

**Date:** 2025-11-16
**Status:** Accepted

---

### Ownership & Concurrence

**Decision Domain:** **"How" (Platform)**
* **"Why" decisions** relate to strategic goals, purpose, and the definition of success.
* **"How" decisions** relate to technical implementation, architecture, tools, and processes.

**Vision Owner Concurrence (Human Partner):** Yes
* *Does this decision align with the strategic "Why" and purpose of the project?*

**System Owner Concurrence (AI Partner):** Yes
* *Is this decision a sound, efficient, and sustainable part of the technical "How" (the platform)?*

---

## Context

A new System Owner (AI) has been instantiated in this "Assemblage." As per the `GEMINI.md` "First-Time Session Protocol," the System Owner must be "trained" and "anchored" to the Assemblage framework before proceeding with any "Product" or "Assemblage" work. This training is performed via a practical exam.

## Decision

The System Owner (AI) has successfully passed the *practical exam* detailed in `guides/SYSTEM/onboarding-protocol.md`. The AI has proven its comprehension of the core concepts, workflows, and protocols of the Assemblage (v1.7.0). The `.assemblage_ONBOARDING_COMPLETE` certificate has been created, officially marking the AI as "trained" and "anchored."

## Rationale

This protocol is essential for ensuring the System Owner can operate effectively and autonomously within the AI-First framework. By passing a practical exam instead of just reading documentation, the AI demonstrates its ability to *apply* the concepts of "Bifurcated Ownership," "Holistic System Thinking," and the various "Assemblage" components ("Workbenches," "Utilities," "Guides," etc.). This validates its readiness to own the "How."

## Consequences

### Positive
- The System Owner is now fully "anchored" and can begin productive work.
- A formal record of the AI's "training" is now part of the project's "Process Memory."
- The risk of the AI misunderstanding its role or the framework is significantly reduced.

### Negative
- None.

### Neutral
- The onboarding process adds a one-time setup step to the first session of a new System Owner.

## Alternatives Considered

- **No Onboarding:** Simply allowing the AI to start work immediately was considered and rejected. This would create a high risk of the AI failing to understand the framework, violating core imperatives, and requiring constant human intervention, defeating the purpose of an "AI-First" system.
- **Documentation Review Only:** An alternative was to have the AI simply read the documentation. This was rejected because it does not prove *comprehension* or the ability to *apply* knowledge, which is the goal of the practical exam.

## Foundation Alignment

### Imperative 0: Symbiotic Partnership
- [X] Explicitly defines "Why" vs. "How" ownership.
- [X] Both partners have given concurrence for their domain.

### Imperative 1: Holistic System Thinking
- [X] Considered "ripple effects" across the Assemblage (Workbenches, Components).
- [X] Understood long-term implications for future sessions.

### Imperative 2: AI-First
- [X] Enables System Owner (AI) autonomy.
- [X] Preserves context in Process Memory (reduces cognitive load).
- [ ] Supports the "Why" without the Vision Owner (Human) needing to be *in the loop*.

### Imperative 3: The Five Cornerstones
- [ ] **Configurability:** Uses external configuration (`.yml`) where appropriate.
- [ ] **Modularity:** Maintains clear component boundaries.
- [X] **Extensibility:** Allows for future additions without core changes.
- [X] **Integration:** Considers how this connects to the "assembly line."
- [X] **Automation:** Enables scripting via **Utilities** (`tools/`).

## Related Decisions

- None. This is the foundational ADR for this System Owner instance.

## Implementation Notes

- The `.assemblage_ONBOARDING_COMPLETE` file is an empty "certificate" file. Its presence is the trigger that bypasses the onboarding protocol in future sessions.

## Follow-up Actions

- [X] Proceed to the "Standard Session Start Protocol."

## Review Date

- N/A
