# ITEM-029: Implement Automated Self-Report Metrics

**Date Created:** 2025-11-22
**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** Medium
**Owner:** Architect

## 1. Description

Enhance the AI Self-Report generated by the `feedback` command to include Automated Self-Report Metrics, as defined in `ADR-022`. This involves refactoring the `commit_wrapper` to capture structured data about its operations and integrating this data into the feedback report.

## 2. "Why" (The Source Material)

* **Decision (The "Why"):**
    * `decisions/ADR-022-automated-self-report-metrics.md`

## 3. "What" (Acceptance Criteria)

- [ ] The `commit_wrapper.py` is refactored to capture and log structured data (e.g., linting errors fixed, test coverage changes) for each commit.
- [ ] This structured data is stored in a temporary, machine-readable format (e.g., JSON) linked to the commit hash.
- [ ] The `feedback` command is modified to read this structured log data for the specified commit.
- [ ] The `ai_self_report` section of the feedback YAML is populated with these objective metrics, replacing "N/A" for `self_correction_loops` and adding new relevant fields.
- [ ] If `validate --coverage` is run during the commit, its output is parsed and included in the self-report.
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests are created for the enhanced `commit_wrapper` and `feedback` command.
