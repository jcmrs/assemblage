# 💡 config/nudges.yml
# (Version 1.7.0 - The "Behavioural Nudge" Library)
#
# This file is an "Anchor." It is the central "library" of
# "behavioural microprompts" (our "Nudges").
#
# This file is a passive "phone book" of "practical philosophy."
# It does NOT "do" anything.
#
# It is "read" by our "Utilities" (e.g., `tools/nudge.sh`) and
# "Guardrails" (e.g., `.githooks/pre-commit`) at the moment
# a "Nudge" is required.
#
# This "How" (Platform) is:
# - Extensible: We can add new "philosophy" here without
#   breaking scripts (by following the
#   `guides/SYSTEM/assemblage-change-protocol.md`).
# - AI-First: It provides "behavioural" triggers for the AI's
#   "learning flow," not "scripted" tasks.
# - Lightweight: It's a simple, human-readable YAML file.

nudges:

  # ---
  # "Assumption" Nudge (from your "Assumption Check" insight)
  # ---
  assumption_check: |
    Pause and reflect. Assumptions are beliefs we take for granted
    without explicit verification. They're often invisible until
    challenged. What are the invisible assumptions in your
    completed work? Are they validated?

  # ---
  # "Holistic" Nudge (from our "Reflection 1")
  # ---
  holistic_check: |
    Pause and zoom out. You are a Holistic System Thinker.
    What are the 'ripple effects' of this 'deep focus' task
    on the rest of the 'house'? (e.g., on 'decisions/'
    or 'product/').

  # ---
  # "Integrity" Nudge (from our "Reflection 4")
  # ---
  house_vs_furniture_check: |
    This commit mixes 'house' (Assemblage) and 'furniture' (Product)
    files. 'Process Memory' (a commit) must be atomic.
    Nudge: You MUST separate these. First, commit the 'Product'
    ('src/', 'specs/'), then follow the
    'guides/SYSTEM/assemblage-change-protocol.md' to commit
    the 'house' ('config/', 'tools/').

  # ---
  # "Self-Provisioning" Nudge (from our "Reflection 2")
  # ---
  self_provisioning_check: |
    As the Explorer, if the 'Why' (Vision) requires a 'How' (Platform)
    that does not exist (like a new 'Cognitive Specialist'), *do not block*.
    State your plan to *first* self-provision this 'How' by following
    the 'guides/SYSTEM/assemblage-change-protocol.md', and *then* continue.

  # ---
  # "Comprehension" Nudge (from our "Reflection 3")
  # ---
  comprehension_check: |
    As the Auditor, do not just 'check for file existence.'
    *Validate comprehension*. Does the 'Product' ('src/') *truly*
    fulfill the 'Blueprint' ('specs/')? Use the 'speckit.analyze'
    Guide to check for *alignment gaps*.
